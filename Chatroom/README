My partner was Kyle Beard

To compile the project, you need to locate the json-simple-1.1.jar file and include this in the compilation.

The command to run the server is 
java cp :./<path to jar file>/json-simple-1.1.jar ChatroomServer

And the command to run the client is
java cp :./<path to jar file>/json-simple-1.1.jar ChatScreen localHost <DesiredUsername>

This should launch the chat screen and run on the ChatroomServer

To be honest, I thought Kyle and I worked well together. He worked a lot on the ChatScreen/Helper Thread (client)
and I worked on the Server and Connection (server)
All in all, I would say that the work distribution was even.
